- Make codegen and VM use result and try for failures
- Use `debug` macro for debugging output
- Fix up evaluator API
- Clean up parser formatting and error messages
    - Should show line/col for EOF
- Create `include` rustclip (requires nicer evaluator setup)
- RustDoc Documentation
- Unit tests
- Clean up examples, readme, etc.
- Stack trace for function calls
    - Have codegen generate mapping from ops to lines (and even columns)
        - Columns requires revamping parser and token structures a bit, may save that for later
        - Can show caret line if columns are available
    - On function call, push to stack trace, pop on return
- Separate Housecat library from interpreter executable
- Dynamically load rust libraries
- Fix \r\n issue with line/col counting?
